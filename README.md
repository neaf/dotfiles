# Piel's combined dotfiles

One repo to rule the all, One repo to find them,

One repo to bring them all and in the system bind them

In the land of Github where Octocat dwells

## Homesick

This is a [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) repository for painless dotfiles management.

To vanquish all the settings and replace with those in this repo:

```
gem install homesick
homesick clone pielgrzym/dotfiles
homesick symlink dotfiles # this deletes stuff, you've been warned!
```

## Featuring

### VIMRC

Now using [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) instead of Git submodules. Apocalypse now.


### ZSHRC

Refactored, split into smaller files.

### TMUX

Still work in progress.
